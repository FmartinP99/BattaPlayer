# BattaPlayer (Work in Progress)

### A Windows Media Player app written in C# using Windows Forms, with MVC pattern and SQLite3.

- Custom controls.
- Supports multiple playlists, and autoplay. 
- Can import songs via Drag&Drop and Import button.
- In order to add medias to the app, you need to create a playlist first.
- MVC Pattern.
- Optimized SQL query using transaction for batch import. (Imports 1700 songs 10 times faster than via raw inserts)
- UI Is not my passion.
